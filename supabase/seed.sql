('Human Rights in a Global World', 'The variety of associated courses in this Pathway reflects the importance of theories of universal human rights and their applications to a multitude of issues involving oppressed and disadvantaged human groups around the globe. Most current debates focus on historical or contemporary cases of discrimination based on racial identity, gender, caste, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and age, which have produced deep social and economic inequalities, often given rise to violence, and occasionally led to ethnic cleansing and mass murder. At the same time, critics of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 also debate whether its definition of human rights exceeds what individuals can fairly demand from society and the state. Enforcing laws based on a concept of human rights often produces controversy. Laws protecting the rights of minorities, immigrants, and/or refugees can infringe on what rival social groups consider to be their human rights. The definition of who is human, and thus deserving of these rights, also raises complex social, ethical and legal issues. If the unborn child, fertilized egg or even unfertilized egg is legally defined as a rights-bearing human being, how might that legal definition impinge on the rights of women and the general public? Can we even take for granted the universal applicability to other cultural traditions of human rights that were invented in the Enlightenment and expanded in Western thought and practice since then? Must we recognize a cultural bias in our own claims for human rights when we encounter cultures with a different social logic in keeping with their own religious and philosophical understandings? These are only some of the probing questions that any student who embarks on a Pathway on human rights in a global world will encounter.', '["ANTH12A","ARTH143","ARTH144","ARTH145","ARTH185","ECON135","ENGL2A","ENGL12A","ENGL150EL","ENGL152","ENGL153","ENGL156","ENGL156A","ENGL156B","ENGL165","ENGL166","FREN112","FREN175","GNSX121","GNSX122","GNSX136","GNSX147","GNSX153","GNSX156","GNSX169","HIST21","HIST39","HIST40","HIST43","HIST102S","HIST112","HIST115S","HIST118","HIST121","HIST122","HIST130","HIST130A","HIST130B","HIST139","HIST140","HIST140S","HIST143","INTL139","MGMT178","PHIL108","PHIL110","PHIL118","PHIL121","RSOC33","RSOC136","SCTR128","SCTR157","SCTR158","TESP46","TESP46H"]', 'https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/integrations/pathways/pathway-listings--courses/human-rights-in-a-global-world/'),

The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution.

('HIST143', 'The Haitian Revolution in World History', 'Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.

Second, the course will analyze the aesthetic appeal of music from different traditions, in terms of the impact of lyrics, melodies, and other elements of songs and compositions. And, third, it will consider how global music reflects and, in turn, shapes politics and power relations, whether in everyday life or in movements for social change and political protests. The course will look at how musical genres from particular areas of the world have traveled and taken on new forms in other parts of the globe, for example, how African rhythms have shaped jazz and rock or how American protest songs of the 60s have been deployed as powerful statements against authoritarianism continents away. We will pay special attention to the impact of internet-related developments on global music, such as the disruption to the industry caused by streaming technologies and platforms like Spotify, new forums now available to musicians, such as YouTube, and direct access to global audiences without traditional channels of distribution. The global musical traditions covered include jazz, Afro-Cuban and Latin music, rock, hip-hop, fusion, Indian film songs, Flamenco, Rai, disco, EDM, and global percussion traditions.
